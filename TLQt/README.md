TerraLens Qt

The TerraLens Qt library allows for a simplified process for adding a TerraLens Viewport to a Qt widget by either rendering directly into the window or by using an intermediate OpenGL texture. The TerraLens Q Viewport classes will feed keyboard, mouse and mouse wheel inputs into it's InputControl object.
