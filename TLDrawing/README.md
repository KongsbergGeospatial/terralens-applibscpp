# TerraLens Drawing #

Classes for drawing shapes in a TerraLens application.
The DrawSimpleInput class is used for adding points to one of the shape model classes (MarkerModel, PolygonModel, PolylineModel). Clicking a point on the screen will add a new point to current shape.
The DrawEditInput is used for editing the current shape. Dragging an existing point will move that point to a new location.
